# Electronics Store Inventory Python Module
Project 1 for Data Structures by Jared Byer

Welcome! This project allows the user to create and manage an inventory designed for an electronics store.
There are many features included in this project, such as:
  - Creating inventory table and automatically adding new items to table
  - Automatically storing variables and table with SQLITE3 and pickle
  - Generating report at any time, using SQLITE3 table to CSV conversion
    - Note: Generated report uses .csv, allowing easy conversion to excel
  - Auto-adding items to inventory may be disabled, allowing user to edit AddItem() class objects and add to inventory later
  - Simple security system utilizing base64 encoding, preventing unauthorized access to delicate inventory table
    - Note: Security system has flaws which will be discussed later

This project includes several files, including main.py, main-example.py, and
